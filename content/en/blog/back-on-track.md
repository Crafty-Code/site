I lost sight of what I wanted to achieve with this blog and who the audience is. I stopped writing when I realised this. I had tried SubStack and it seems ok, but I'm not sure it's for me. The social media side of it seemed to have a lot of "comment here and I'll repost / share your stack" as a concept the site is good, but I wanted more control. An example of this is that I wanted to publish the content in more than one language. SubStack couldn't support this. I'm not 100% comfortable with Subscription models and managing the content. There is a lot of pressure to keep writing each week and guilt if you miss a post. I found I was only writing paid posts to make a subscription worth while. I'd rather something more like "buy me a coffee" or my own implementation of it for articles. Eventually the best approach for me would be sponsorship and partnering with companies that I like and use their products. I just want to focus on writing.

Now back to the content, recently I found myself writing about Trade Wars and starting a Small Business. I struggled to link them back to the name Crafty Code, to the point where I was considering re-naming my blog or creating a new purely business & economics based blog. They are also areas I'm not qualified to talk on, I have opinions about them but my areas of expertise are leadership, software development and business strategy. I'm not an economist. I just have an interest in economics. Anything that isn't related to the 3 core areas are probably better suited for bonus material, and that is where a paywall is better. I will look at creating another AI Agent to act as an editor and make sure my content is on topic. 

Going forward, I'll stay within my lane and will focus on my own site where I have full control of what I do and can deliver the content as I wish. This will mean it will take a while to get some parts of the blog up and running.
