At Crafty Code, the aim is to link the world of Software Development to its place in the real world.

While there's already a wealth of content focused on the US, Crafty Code will focus on the EU's software development and business landscape.

## My name is Jeff

I write code, lead, and manage software teams. I'm also interested in business and its place in our world.

### Background

- MSc. Strategy Management UCD Smurfit Business School (2022-2024)
- Dip. Leadership Dorset College (2020)
- BSc. & MSc in Software Engineering - Dublin City University (2005-2011)
- 10+ years in Software Industry

## Why am I doing this?

I went back to do a master's in Business Strategy Management. I enjoyed working on researching and writing about a topic while I was studying.

I learned many things while studying that I will forget if I don't use them regularly. This blog will help me continue to practice and develop these skills.

### Content & Themes

I'll follow my interests on this. It will be a mix of software and technology. My interests are particularly in cycling, gaming, and music.

I want to cover leadership & management, business strategy and software development. I'll look at what is happening in the news and use that as a base to write about.

## A little side hustle

Of course, I want to earn something off this or at least cover my costs. I'll try a few ways of doing this. The aim would be to monetize this in the least intrusive way possible (no pop-ups)

## Use of AI

I will use AI to help me write and research. It will be a tool and an assistant, not a generator of written content. AI will be used to generate images and graphics for the site.
