At Crafty Code, the aim is to link the world of Software Development to its place in the real world.

While there's already a wealth of content focused on the US, Crafty Code will focus on the EU's software development and business landscape.

## My name is Jeff

I write code, lead, and manage software teams. I'm also interested in business and its place in our world. My view is that share holder value is not what we should aim for, business should look to improve society and environment that it interacts with. Sustainability for me is as much about the environment, but also creating the conditions for your customers to be able to use your product. 

### Background

- MSc. Strategy Management UCD Smurfit Business School (2022-2024)
- Dip. Leadership Dorset College (2020)
- BSc. & MSc in Software Engineering - Dublin City University (2005-2011)
- 10+ years in Software Industry

## Why am I doing this?

I went back to do a master's in Business Strategy Management. I enjoyed working on researching and writing about a topic while I was studying.

I learned many things while studying that I will forget if I don't use them regularly. This blog will help me continue to practice and develop these skills.

### Content & Themes

I'll follow my interests on this. It will be a mix of software and technology. My interests are particularly in cycling, gaming, and music.

I want to cover leadership & management, business strategy and software development. I'll look at what is happening in the news and use that as a base to write about. I'll look at examples of leaders including fictional characters.

## A little side hustle

Of course, I want to earn something off this or at least cover my costs. I'll try a few ways of doing this. The aim would be to monetise this in the least intrusive way possible (no pop-ups). Sponsorship will be my preferred option, but that will take a while. I'm not overly comfortable with subscription models, I don't want to rely on readers, I'd like to give this for free.

## Use of AI

I will use AI to help me write and research. It will be a tool and an assistant, not a generator of written content. AI will be used to generate images and graphics for the site. It will also be used to generate the translations. I don't have any great way of validating the translations that, so sorry if there are mistakes.
